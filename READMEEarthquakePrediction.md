# EarthquakePrediction
So, in this project I made a prediction of the Earthquakes which can occur in Greece in the future with help of a dataset having data of more than past 200 years.
I have used some Machine learning Algorithms like Linear Regression to predict the Earthquakes.
Firstly, I imported some of the common machine learning libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn, and various others to run the corresponding commands in the file.
The IDE used is Jupyter Notebook.
y_cap is the predicted value which can be treated as the % chances of the upcoming earthquakes.
However, the Gradient Decent method has been used in this algorithm to preidict the values with help of some samples and features of the dataset.
